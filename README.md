## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to stack two images ontop of each other and then hide one behind the other one. Using position absolute and relative really helped. 


### Continued development

I want to get more practice with CSS, I want to get better at it and use less help when writing it.


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) - MDN always helps me when I get stuck.
- [Google](https://www.google.com) - When I don't know how to do something, I look it up on Google or MDN.
